# Resume Integration Test Issue

## Problem
The resume integration test was removed from the test suite due to persistent hanging and duplicate avoidance issues. The test previously used caifrazier.com as the seed domain and attempted to validate checkpoint and resume logic.

## Reproduction Steps
1. Run a crawl with checkpointing enabled.
2. Cancel mid-crawl and resume from checkpoint.
3. Observe duplicate avoidance and crawl completion status.

## Observed Output
- Test hangs or fails to complete.
- Checkpoint events are emitted, but crawl.finished may not fire as expected.
- Duplicates may not be reliably avoided on resume.

## Diagnostic Logs
- See logs in `archive/` for checkpoint.saved and crawl.finished events.
- Debug output from bus event listeners included in previous runs.

## Next Steps
- Refactor checkpoint and resume logic for reliability.
- Add more granular event diagnostics.
- Consider isolating browser/session state between resume phases.
- Track this issue for future test coverage restoration.
