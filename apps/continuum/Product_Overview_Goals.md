Continuum MVP Definition

MVP Goal

Deliver a stable, performant desktop SEO auditing application built on Cartographer and Atlas that allows professionals to ingest, analyze, and compare crawls locally. The MVP must validate Continuum’s core principles—ownership, transparency, and depth—while minimizing feature scope to reach a usable first release.

MVP Success Criteria

Continuum can open, validate, and visualize Atlas files generated by Cartographer.

Projects can organize multiple Atlases and perform comparisons.

Users can identify and understand core SEO issues with transparent scoring.

Light accessibility checks (alt text, empty anchors, basic ARIA misuse) are visible where relevant.

The UI demonstrates Continuum’s visual identity and local-first workflow.

Core MVP Features

1. Atlas Handling

Import single or multiple Atlas files.

Validate file integrity and required schema parts.

Display Atlas metadata: origin URL, crawl date, mode, page count.

Cache parsed data locally (SQLite or DuckDB).

2. Projects & One-Off Crawls

Create projects and assign imported Atlases to them.

Run one-off crawls through Cartographer CLI integration.

Manage recent Atlases per project, auto-selecting two most recent for comparison.

Rename or delete projects within sidebar.

3. Atlas Comparison (Cartographer-Driven)

Provide two Atlas files to Cartographer’s diff engine.

Display differences in Continuum: new, removed, changed URLs.

Highlight metadata changes (titles, descriptions, canonicals).

Simple summary table with counts and trend indicators.

4. Dashboard View

High-level overview with KPIs: total pages, 200/300/400/500 counts, indexability ratio, missing titles/descriptions, and duplicate titles.

Accessibility (light) tile: counts for missing alt, empty link anchors, and suspicious aria-* usage.

Project health score using global default rule weights.

Tile-based cards with counts, rates, and severity level (Low/Medium/High).

Click any tile to jump to corresponding tab with filters applied.

5. Tabbed Views

Metadata Tab: Titles, descriptions, canonicals, missing/duplicate detection.

Links Tab: Orphans, broken internal links, total link counts.

Indexability Tab: Status codes, noindex, canonical mismatches.

Assets Tab: Broken or missing assets (from Atlas assets part).

Accessibility Tab (light): Missing/empty alt, empty anchors, invalid aria-label/aria-labelledby references; each row links to the page and highlights selector if available.

6. Scoring & Rule Management

Global rule weight file (JSON) stored in user configuration.

Users can view (not edit) rule weights in MVP.

Project health score calculated transparently using these defaults.

7. UI / UX Core

Global Header: Logo, Settings, and “Open in” buttons for Horizon and Vector; breadcrumb for Project/Atlas context.

Sidebar: Project list with favicon, URL, health score indicator, and + button.

Dashboard: Tile grid view, severity badges, compare toggle.

Tabs: Compact tables with sorting, filtering, and quick summaries.

Theme: Dark, tactile visual style consistent with brand.

8. Data Architecture

Atlas NDJSON → cached relational tables.

Queries handled locally (no external API calls).

Derived tables for quick aggregation.

Config and cache stored in user’s local app directory.

Outcome: Validates the Cartographer + Continuum loop, establishing the user experience and data model baseline for future expansion.

User Flows (MVP)

1) First Run → Import → Inspect

Launch Continuum → Empty state with CTA buttons: Import Atlases, Run One-Off, Create Project.

Choose Import Atlases → file picker supports single or bulk .atls.

Validation runs; success list shows site, crawl date, page count, favicon.

Select an Atlas → Atlas Viewer opens on Dashboard with KPIs and light a11y tile.

Click Missing Titles tile → lands in Metadata Tab with filter applied.

2) Create Project → Crawl → Compare

Click Create Project and Crawl in header dropdown.

Enter origin URL, render mode, and limits → Start.

Cartographer runs; progress appears in status bar.

When complete, Atlas added to project’s Atlases list and opens on Dashboard.

Run second crawl later → project now shows two Atlases.

Toggle Compare in the global header (always visible) → selects two most recent; diff badges appear across tiles and tabs.

3) One-Off Crawl → Decide Next Step

Click Run One-Off.

Provide crawl settings → Start.

On completion, Atlas opens in Atlas Viewer.

Header shows actions: Export Atlas, Create Project from This, Open in Horizon/Vector.

4) Investigate an Issue from Dashboard

On Dashboard, Accessibility (light) tile shows counts for missing alt and empty anchors.

Click tile → Accessibility Tab (light) with table of affected pages and selector hints.

Select a row → Inspector panel shows: page URL, snippet (if available), selector path, and “Open page in default browser.”

Use header’s Open Atlas in Horizon to deep-dive later if needed.

5) Compare-Side Detail Flow

With Compare enabled (global header), open Metadata Tab.

Each row shows left/right values (current vs previous) for title, description, canonical.

Use Changed Only filter to focus on deltas.

Click a row → Diff Inspector shows old/new values with highlight and a severity note based on scoring.

Read-Only Model

Continuum MVP is strictly read-only with respect to site content. No inline editing, no export-for-edit flows.

All actions are investigative: filter, sort, inspect, compare, and export Atlas (file-level only).

Any remediation editing belongs downstream (CMS, Git, or separate task tooling later).

Screen Blueprints (MVP)

A) Global Header (persistent on every view)

Left: Product logo • View title (Dashboard / Metadata / Links / Indexability / Assets / Accessibility)

Center: Breadcrumb (Projects / {Project} / {Atlas Date})

Right: Compare toggle • Open in Horizon • Open in Vector • Settings • Help

Behavior:

Compare toggle persists and reflects state globally.

When Compare is ON, a secondary pill appears beneath the header showing the two selected Atlases with a quick switcher.

B) Dashboard

Layout: 2x3 tile grid above a half-height "Highlights" table.

Tiles (clickable):

Pages by status (bar mini-chart) • Indexable ratio • Missing titles • Duplicate titles • Missing descriptions • A11y (light) issues

Highlights table: Top 20 URLs with the largest severity contributions. Columns: URL • Issue • Severity • Template (if present) • Changed (Δ) when Compare ON.

Empty states: Human, instructive copy (e.g., “Import an Atlas to see your site’s health at a glance.”)

C) Metadata Tab

Header controls: Compare toggle • Date picker for A/B selection (when ON) • Filters quickbar (Missing, Duplicate, Long/Short)

Table columns: URL • Title • Title length • Meta description • Description length • Canonical • Robots • Δ (when Compare ON)

Row interaction: Select to open right-side Inspector pane with full values, diffs, and "Why flagged" rationale.

Saved views: Missing titles • Duplicate titles • Non-self canonicals.

D) Accessibility (Light) Tab

Scope: Missing/empty alt, empty anchors, invalid aria-* references.

Table columns: URL • Issue type • Selector (if present) • Context snippet (if present) • Count • Δ (when Compare ON)

Inspector: Shows selector path, snippet, and links to open page in browser or open Atlas in Horizon.

E) Links Tab (MVP scope)

Focus: Orphans and broken internal links.

Table columns: URL • Inlinks • Outlinks • Orphan? • Broken internal links • Δ (when Compare ON)

Quick actions: "Show orphans only" toggle; Open selected in Metadata tab.

F) Indexability Tab

Table columns: URL • HTTP status • Robots meta • Canonical status (self/non-self/missing) • Noindex? • Δ (when Compare ON)

Filters: Status class chips; Canonical correctness chip.

G) Assets Tab

Focus: Broken/missing assets and heavy assets if bytes present.

Table columns: URL • Asset issues count • 4xx/5xx assets • Total bytes (if available) • Δ (when Compare ON)

Interaction Rules & Microcopy (MVP)

Tiles always show Count • Rate • Severity.

Severity badges: Low / Medium / High with tooltips explaining reasoning.

Compare mode marks New, Removed, Changed with concise badges.

Keyboard: ⌘/Ctrl+F focuses filter; ⌘/Ctrl+K opens global command palette (post-MVP optional).

Destructive actions require confirmation.

Navigation & Header Behavior (Updated)

Compare toggle is always in the header on every tab.

Date/Atlas picker appears contextually under the header when Compare is ON.

Sidebar search filters projects by name, domain, or tag; recent items pinned.

Light Accessibility Scope (Data Contract)

Continuum expects Atlas to surface for MVP:

a11y part or page-level fields providing counts for: missing/empty alt, empty anchors, invalid aria-* references.

Optional: selector paths and short HTML snippets for inspector context.

If absent, Continuum shows a neutral message and hides the a11y tile.
